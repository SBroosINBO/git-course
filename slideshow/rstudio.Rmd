---

### Make a commit

1. Add a commit message and click commit

![Local commit](images/commit-rstudio4.png)

---

### Push the changes to GitHub

1. Note that the `git` pane displays _your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits_
1. Click `push` in the `git` pane

![Push](images/push-rstudio1.png)

---

### Go to your repo on GitHub to verify

![Verify your commits on GitHub](images/local-commit-on-github.png)

---

### Store your credentials when using https

1. Click on the `more` button in the `git pane` and select `shell`
1. Type `git config --global credential.helper store`
1. Type `exit` to quit the shell
1. The next time `git` needs your credentials, it will ask them one more time and store them

![Store credentials](images/https-credentials-rstudio1.png)


---

### Create logical commits

1. Make 2 unrelated changes to your `README.md` locally
2. Create one commit for each change.
3. Do NOT push (yet)

---

### Create logical commits

1. Click `Commit` in the `git` pane
1. Select the changes you want to commit and click `stage selection`
1. Add a `commit message` and click `Commit`

![Logical commit 1](images/logical-commit-rstudio.png){width=80%}

---

### Create logical commits

- `stage xyz`: add the xyz from the commit
- `unstage xyz`: remove the xyz from the commit
- `discard xyz`: revert the changes in the xyz (can't be undone!!!)
- `xyz` can be
    - a single `line`
    - a `selection` of lines
    - a `chunk`
        - RStudio will automatically split the changes in chunks
        - chunks are defined by 10 unchanged lines between changes

---

### Create a conflict

Update your `README.md` on GitHub,<br/>
on a line you also edited locally

![Commit to create conflict](images/commit-to-create-conflict.png)

---

### Conflict!

Try to push (click `push`) your local changes

![Conflict](images/conflict-rstudio1.png)

---

### Keep calm and resolve conflict

1. Click `Pull` to download the changes from Github

![Conflict](images/conflict-rstudio2.png)

---

### Keep calm and resolve conflict

1. Open `README.md` in RStudio:

        <<<<<<< HEAD
        A simple analysis to visualize my favourite fruit colour.
        =======
        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit color.
        >>>>>>> origin/main

2. Choose what you want to keep:

        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit colour.

3. Commit and click `push`

---

### Add a file

1. Add a `fruits.csv` file in a `/data` directory
2. Link to this file in the `README.md`

![Add a file](images/add-file-rstudio1.png)

---

### Add a file within a directory

- Staging a new directory will stage all files in the directory
- You can't stage empty directories

![Add a file](images/add-file-rstudio2.png)

---

### Adapt last commit

- **Warning:** don't do this on commits that have been pushed. That would result in conflicts.
- Make a change in `fruits.csv`
- `Commit` as usual but **check** `amend previous commit` under the commit message box

![Add a file](images/amend-commit-rstudio.png){width=60%}

---

### View history

- Click on `history` in the `git` pane
![View history](images/history-rstudio1.png)

---

### View history

![View history](images/history-rstudio2.png)

---

### Create a branch to experiment

1. Create a NEW branch
2. Add an analysis file in a `/src` directory
3. Commit
4. Switch between branches

---

### Create a branch to experiment

1. Open the git shell
1. Create a branch by a checkout to new branch 
    ```
    git checkout -b analysis-script
    ```
1. Get an overview of your branches: `git branch`

![Create branch](images/create-branch-rstudio.png)

---

### Effect of changing switching branches

Add a file to the repository in a `src`-directory (see earlier)

1. Go back to the status of the `main` branch
1. Click on `analysis-script` in the `git` pane and select `(LOCAL BRANCHES) -> main`
![Switch branch](images/branch-rstudio1.png)

![Switch branch](images/branch-rstudio2.png)

---

### Effect of changing switching branches

1. Verify your local directory structure: where are your files?
1. Go back to the status of the new branch (e.g. `analysis-script`)
1. Verify your local directory structure again: where are your files?

---

### First push of a new branch

1. Notice that the `pull` and `push` buttons in the `git` pane are grayed out
1. Open the Git Shell
1. Type `git push -u origin analysis-script`

This will also activate the `pull` and `push` buttons

![First push branch](images/branch-first-push-rstudio.png)


---

### Create a pull request to include your work 

1. Click `push` 
2. At [Github](https://github.com/), browse to you repo...
3. Create a `pull request`

---

### Create a pull request to include your work 

![Check Github message pull request](images/pull-request-intro.png)

---

### Create a pull request to include your work 

![Adapt Github message and start pull request](images/pull-request_message.png)

---

### Review your pull request

![See pull request](images/pr.png)

---

### Review your pull request

1. Review
2. If OK, merge pull request
3. Delete branch

---

### Include your accepted work to local main

1. Switch to `main` branch
2. Click `pull`.

![git pull](images/pull-rstudio.png)

---

### Exclude files

* in any programming language, some files are _derivatives_
* sensitive information (passwords,...)
* a folder with large data files that should not be in the history (and backuped elsewhere!)
* a _temp/_ folder for just garbage you create/...

`.gitignore` to the rescue!

---

### Exclude files

![Ignore a file](images/gitignore-rstudio1.png){width=30%}

Note that you can use wild cards e.g. `*.Rproj`

## Working together {data-background=#c2c444}

---

### Teaming up

* Team up with two or three persons
* Let one person invite the others, provide them with read/write access as explained in [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)

---

### Invite collaborators

![Invite collaborator](images/invite-collaborator.png)

---

### Invite collaborators

![react to collaborator](images/react-collaborator.png)

---

### Collaboration: issues

* Raise an **issue** online
* Provide issues with an appropriate label
* Assign your colleague to the issue

---

### Collaboration: online adaptations

* Make an adaptation to an online file
* Propose a **pull request** and assign your collaborator
* Merge the adaptation to the `main` branch

---

### Collaboration: local adaptations

**Working local - merging online**

* As collaborator, `clone` the other repository to your local computer
* Create a new `branch` with a different name
* Adapt the content of a file
* `commit` your adaptation
* `push` your `branch` to the remote repository
* Go to GitHub and make a `pull request`
* Revise the work and `merge` online when appropriate
* Update your local work
* Check if all adaptations are represented in your local files

**Tip**: All functionalities are available in the previous sections

---

### Release

Once you are satisfied with the status of your analysis, it makes sense to create a release:

* For publications (DOI)
* For code/software development versions
* For course notes

Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) to create a release.

---

### Some more advice:

* Commit often, make small commits
* Donâ€™t mix changes in 1 commit
* Think about your commit messages
* Keep your code clean, avoid huge one-liners
* Use branches (!)
* Donâ€™t keep long-lived branches (form of technical debt)

---
