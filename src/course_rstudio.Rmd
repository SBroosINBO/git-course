# Setup

When starting this tutorial, we assume:

* you have [R](https://lib.ugent.be/CRAN/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed on your computer
* you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer

---

# Working on your own {data-background=#c2c444}

We start with you working on a repository, without interference of colleagues

---

## Create a repository

A new project starts with a new repository, which can be easily setup using [GitHub.com](https://github.com).

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and login
2. Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) to create a repo and [create your first (online) commit](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change) to your repository
</div>

---

For this first exercise, we have chosen to create a dummy repository:

![Create a repo](./static/images/create-a-repo.png)
(*you do not have to copy the example, choose any name :-)*)

---

The resulting repository layout will look like this:

![Result of creating a repo](./static/images/create-repo-result.png)
(*Remember that there is a `Clone or Download` button on this page!*)

## Git for RStudio configuration

As we will mainly use Git(Hub) to manage R/Rmarkdown scripts, the existing integration of Rstudio and Git provides a convenient way to add version control. 

### Installation

Just to make sure, in case you did not already installed Git and Rstudio:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [install](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/installation/administrator/admin_install_git/) Git
1. Install [RStudio](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/installation/administrator/admin_install_rstudio/)
</div>

When installed properly:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Open [RStudio](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/installation/user/user_install_rstudio/)
</div>

---

### Configuration

In order to start using version control in Rstudio, we have to do some configuration the first time. You only need to do this configuration once.

First of all, tell RStudio where to find the Git installation. 

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Go to `Tools > Global Options`
1. Click on `Git/SVN`.
1. Check *Enable version control interface for RStudio projects*
1. Set the path to the Git executable that you installed*
1. Check *use Git bash as shell for Git projects*
</div>

---

*If you do not know where Git is installed, open your command line (`cmd` in Start for Windows user). When the cmd is open, type `where git` and hit enter. The path should be something like: `C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe`. Still in trouble? Check [this out](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html#tell-rstudio-where-to-find-git).

![RStudio setup for git](./static/images/RStudio-setup-git.png){width=50%}

---

Next, we have to tell Github who we actually are, in order to make the connection to the online account. To do so, Git requires the configuration of your Github (!) username and GitHub email:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Go to `Tools > Shell` to open the Git Shell
1. In the shell, type the following command and enter:
```
git config --global user.name "mygithubusername"
```
1. Still in the shell, type the following command and enter:
```
git config --global user.email "my.name@inbo.be"
```
</div>

---

![RStudio setup git shell](./static/images/Rstudio-GitShell.png){width=75%}

Use your **GitHub username**! You can check if you're set up correctly by typing  `git config --global --list` in the same shell.

When successful, the configuration is done. Congratulations!

---

## Clone a repo to work locally

We have initiated a repository online and a working Git within Rstudio. Hence, we can start working on the code locally by downloading the repository to our computer. Rstudio provides a convenient way to start a new project as a Git repository.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. On your GitHub repository page, copy the repository **HTTPS** url (*remember the green button?*)
1. In Rstudio, `File > New Project...`, select `Version Control`, choose `Git`
1. Provide the repository HTTPS link you just copied (the project name will be filled in as well)
1. Browse to desired directory where you will manage your project/code
</div>

--- 

To get the https link, you need to click the green button and make sure to copy paste the link with as title `Clone with HTTPS`:

![Copy the https link of a repo](./static/images/copy-repo-link.png){width=75%}

---

An example of the project setup using an existing Git repository:

![Clone a repo in RStudio](./static/images/create-project-rstudio.png){width=75%}

---

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
In your File explorer, search for your project folder and check the content. Does this corresponds to what is shown online on your repository website?
</div>

---

## `.gitignore`

When starting a new project in RStudio, it will always add a file `.gitignore` if it does not already exists (you can actually also create one in the online setup). A `gitignore` file defines all those files that should not be taken into account by Git. An example is the `myprojectname.Rproj` file, as this is a user/computer specific file.

Hence, we can ignore the `myprojectname.Rproj` file by adding the file to the `.gitignore` text-file. We can do this inside Rstudio:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Go to `git` pane (the tab that says Git), 
1. right click on `....Proj` and select `Ignore...`
1. Check if the content of `.gitignore` is correctly updated and click `Save`.
</div>

---

As our dummy project is called `favourite-fruit-color`, the `.Rproj` file is called `favourite-fruit-color.Rproj`. We right click on the file and select `Ignore...`:

![Ignore a file](./static/images/gitignore-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

When to use `.gitignore`:

* in any programming language, some files are _derivatives_
* sensitive information (passwords,...)
* a folder with large data files that should not be in the history (and backuped elsewhere!)
* a _temp/_ folder for just garbage you create/...

---

Note that you can use wild cards e.g. `*.Rproj` to exclude a group of files from the version control:

![Update .gitignore](./static/images/gitignore-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

---

Check the content of the `.gitignore` file. If satisfied, click `Save`:

![Update .gitignore](./static/images/gitignore-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

---

## Make commits

As the `.gitignore` is a newly added file (or at least adapted), we can `commit` this change and provide a commit message:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Go to `git` pane
1. Check the box next to `.gitignore`
1. Click `Commit`
1. Add a `commit message` and click commit
1. Click `Close` to remove the commit summary
</div>

---

The status of the `.gitignore` file before the file was committed, with the yellow question mark saying that the file is yet unknown to Git:

![Local commit](./static/images/commit-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

By checking the box and clicking commit, we add the file and commit this addition with a commit message:

![Local commit](./static/images/commit-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

---

We get a small technical overview of the alterations we provided with this commit: 

![Local commit](./static/images/commit-rstudio3.png){width=75%}

---

It is good practice to **commit often**, so you will do this a lot. Each commit should only contain changes related to a single problem/element/... Each commit is a snapshot of your project and the messages describe the story of your project.

As documentation is crucial, providing some more information in the `README.md` file will help others (and yourself in a couple of months/years) to understand the aim of the project. Just as we adapted the `README.md` file online earlier, we can do the same locally:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Update the `README.md` inside Rstudio
1. Commit your changes
</div>

---

Remark the reporting of the changed lines linked to this commit with green and red colors:

![Local commit](./static/images/commit-rstudio4.png){width=75%}

---

## Push the changes to GitHub

Note that the `git` pane displays *your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits*. This is actually providing you a warning message that there is no backup of these two commits! In order to store these changes on GitHub as well, we have to `push` our changes to GitHub:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Click `push` in the `git` pane
1. Go to your repository on GitHub to verify the commits and file contents
</div>

---

Rstudio gives you a warning about the status of your local commits versus those stored on GitHub:

![Push](./static/images/push-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

Is the `README.md` adapted? Where do you find the Commits overview online?

![Verify your commits on GitHub](./static/images/local-commit-on-github.png){width=75%}

---

## Additional configuration - store your password

It is a tedious task to retype the password each time you want to `push` anything to GitHub. Luckily, you can store your credentials when using https:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Click on the `more` button in the `git` pane and select `Shell`
1. Type `git config --global credential.helper store`
1. Type `exit` to quit the shell
</div>

The next time `git` needs your credentials, it will ask them **one more time and store them**!

---

The more button has a `wheel` symbol:

![Store credentials](./static/images/https-credentials-rstudio1.png){width=75%}


---

## Create logical commits

As mentioned earlier, you should commit often and make sure each commit links to a specific change/problem. Sometimes, this means that you have to split the additions in a single file into two individual commits. Rstudio provides the interface to include specific lines of code into a commit message:

![Logical commit 1](./static/images/logical-commit-rstudio.png){width=75%}

---

To summarize, the following actions can be executed:

- `stage xyz`: add the xyz from the commit
- `unstage xyz`: remove the xyz from the commit
- `discard xyz`: revert the changes in the xyz (be careful, can't be undone!)

and `xyz` can be

- a single `line`
- a `selection` of lines
- a `chunk`
    - RStudio will automatically split the changes in chunks
    - chunks are defined by 10 unchanged lines between changes

---

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Make 2 unrelated changes to your `README.md` locally
1. Create one `commit` for each change:
    1. Select the changes you want to commit and click `stage selection`
    1. Add a `commit message` and click `Commit`
1. Do NOT push (yet)
</div>

---

## Create a conflict!

Sometimes, conflicts will appear. Maybe because a collaborator was working on exactly the same lines of code or because of a mistake in your workflow,... No worries, we'll learn you how to fix conflicts by initiating one.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
Update your `README.md` online on GitHub, on the exact same line you just edited locally in the previous exercise.
</div>

---

If you do not remember how to change files online, check again [this online tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change). Check the result of your online commit, similar to:

![Commit to create conflict](./static/images/commit-to-create-conflict.png){width=75%}

---

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
Back in Rstudio, try to push (click `push`) your local changes.
</div>

---

Git provides a warning about the remote changes on the same repository:

![Conflict](./static/images/conflict-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
Click `Pull` to download the changes from Github
</div>

Git notices the **CONFLICT** and demands you what to do next:

1. Fix conflicts
1. Commit the result after fixing the conflict

![Conflict](./static/images/conflict-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

---

Keep calm and resolve conflict!

Each conflict is always marked by the combination of the following elements:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
your local code
=======
the code as it exists on Github
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

To solve a conflict, you have to decide which version of the code you want to keep. 

---

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Open `README.md` in RStudio:

        <<<<<<< HEAD
        A simple analysis to visualize my favourite fruit colour.
        =======
        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit color.
        >>>>>>> origin/main

2. Choose what you want to keep and only keep that code in the file:

        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit colour.

3. Commit the adaptation with a commit message
4. Click `Push` to update GitHub
</div>

If you encounter a conflict in the future, repeat this procedure.

---

## Add a new file

During a project, new files will be added to the project folder, which need to be version controlled as well. New directories and files can be added and committed, just like any other adaptation. 

By clicking the box next to a file, the file is staged (i.e. ready to be committed). Staging a new directory will stage all files in the directory. However, you can not stage empty directories!

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Add a `fruits.csv` file in a `/data` subdirectory
1. Link to this file in the `README.md` (use relative paths), mentioning the purpose of the file 
1. Commit both changes (new data file and the `README.md` adaptation) in a single commit message
</div>
---

Rstudio provides information about the status of the file:

- `README.md` file is adapted (blue *Modified* box)
- `data/` is currently unknown to Git (yellow *Question mark* box)

![Add a file](./static/images/add-file-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

Clicking both will make them ready to be committed. Remark, the `data/fruits.csv` file gets a green *Added* box:

![Add a file](./static/images/add-file-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

---

## Adapt last commit

Sometimes, you just did a commit of some adaptations, but you see that you missed some lines of code that should be included in the same commit. Git provides the ability to `amend` a previous commit with some additional adaptations.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Make a change in `fruits.csv`
1. `Commit` as usual but **check** `amend previous commit` in the commit message box
</div>

**Warning:** don't do this on commits that have been pushed. That would result in conflicts.

---

Next to the `Commit` box, the `amend` option is available:

![Add a file](./static/images/amend-commit-rstudio.png){width=75%}

---

## View history

One of the advantages of using version control with regular commits is that you get a history of your project. You can check the history (the series of commits) both online on GitHub as well as in Rstudio:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Within Rstudio, click on `history` in the `git` pane
1. On the webpage of your repository, chek the commit list
</div>

---

Notice the presence of `History` twice in the following image: 

- As a separate pane (your R command history): this has nothing to do with Git
- Within the `git` pane (the history of your commit messages)

![View history](./static/images/history-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

You can click on each of the commits to verify the adaptations that were part of the specific commit:

![View history](./static/images/history-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

---

## Create a branch to experiment

### How to make a new branch?

It is good practice to ALWAYS work on (short-living) branches. It allows you to freely experiment until you are satisfied of the result and it ensures your `main` provides the last stable version of your analysis/project.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. click on `Create branch` symbol* (next to the current branch name)
1. Provide a branch name (lowercase, no spaces)
1. Keep remote on `origin`
1. Check the box `Sync branch with remote`
1. Click `Create`
</div>

*the create branch symbol looks as follows:
![](./static/images/rstudio_branch_symbol.png)

---

Make sure your branch name makes sense for the work you are planning to do. Use lower case characters and `-` in between words (NO spaces!). For this example, we decided to use the name `analysis-script` for the branch name. 

![Create branch](./static/images/branch-rstudio3.png){width=75%}

---

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h4>Remark!</h4>
Older versions of Rstudio do not provide the functionality to create a branch directly! You will have to use the `Shell` to create the new branch:
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4>Shell based approach to create a new branch:</h4>
1. Open the git shell
1. Create a branch by a `checkout` to new `branch`:
    ```
    git checkout -b analysis-script
    ```
1. Get an overview of your branches: `git branch`
1. Type `git push -u origin analysis-script` to activate `Push`/`Pull` buttons

Shell based approach to create a new branch:
![Create branch](./static/images/create-branch-rstudio.png){width=75%}

This will also activate the `pull` and `push` buttons. From now on, you can commit as many times as you want/need to this branch and push the commits to GitHub, where it will be stored under the same branch name:

![First push branch](./static/images/branch-first-push-rstudio.png){width=75%}
</div>

---

We can work on the just created branch and start making adaptations:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Add an analysis file in a `/src` directory
1. `Commit` the adaptation to the branch
1. Click `Push` to send the adaptations to Github
1. On GitHub website, look for your branch and check the adaptations to the branch
</div>

---

### Effect of switching branches

The first time you switch branches and you see files disappearing, you might be wondering what is happening. No worries, Git is just making sure you only see those files relevant for the active branch. In the next exercise, we will explore this feature in more detail:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Click on the right-top dropdown in the `git` pane
1. Switch to the status of the `main` branch by selecting `(LOCAL BRANCHES) -> main`
1. Verify your local directory structure in file explorer: where are your files?
1. Switch back to the status of the new branch (in the example i.e. `analysis-script`)
1. Verify your local directory structure in file explorer again: where are your files?
</div>

---

As in our example, the branch name is `analysis-script`, the dropdown defines this as the currently active branch. Clicking on the dropdown provides an overview of all branches:

![Switch branch](./static/images/branch-rstudio1.png){width=75%}

---

Rstudio provides you information about the switch to the `main` branch:

![Switch branch](./static/images/branch-rstudio2.png){width=75%}

<div class="alert alert-danger">
Make sure you are currently working on your newly created branch (e.g. `analysis-script`) before you proceed!
</div>

---

## Pull requests

When satisfied about the work done in a branch, it is time to bring these adaptations to the `main` branch as part of the *stable* analysis. NEVER merge locally on your machine, we will ALWAYS merge a branch online, by making use of a `Pull request`!

---

### Create a pull request

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Click `push` (if not already done)
2. At [Github](https://github.com/), browse to your repository.
3. Create a `pull request` online
</div>

---

Github actually suggests you to `Compare & Pull request` on the webpage in a new yellow box. If you do not see the message, you can still initiate a `Pull request`. The `Pull request` aims to insert the adaptations in your branch into the `main` branch. 

![Check Github message pull request](./static/images/pull-request-intro.png){width=75%}

---

In a new dialog, you can provide a short summary line about the `Pull request` with the option to add additional information. By clicking the `Create pull request` button, you actually propose the merge into the `main` branch.

![Adapt Github message and start pull request](./static/images/pull-request_message.png){width=75%}

---

### Review your pull request

While working on your own and you are sure about the changes, you can actually merge the `Pull request` yourself. Although, this is the ideal moment for revision of the code (you can ask people to review your code, but automated checks can be added as well).

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. Review your own code!
2. If OK, merge the `Pull request`. 
3. Do not forget to delete the branch online (Github asks you to)
</div>

---

![See pull request](./static/images/pr.png){width=75%}


---

### Include your accepted work to local main

For the moment, your adaptations are integrated into the `main` branch online, but not yet on your local computer. So, you have to update the local `main` branch:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
1. In Rstudio, switch to the `main` branch (right top in `Git` pane)
1. Click `Pull`
1. Remove the local branch as well (otherwise you will have a lot of them after a while). You need to open the Shell:
    ```
    git branch -d analysis-script
    ```
</div>

![git pull](./static/images/pull-rstudio.png){width=75%}

---

# Working together {data-background=#c2c444}

---

## Invite collaborators

You now have experienced all the major steps to effectively use version control with Git. We can now apply these same steps when working together.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
* Team up with two or three persons
* Let one person invite the others, provide them with read/write access as explained in [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)
</div>

---

On your own repository, you have all admin rights to add `Collaborators` in the `Settings` section of GitHub:

![Invite collaborator](./static/images/invite-collaborator.png){width=75%}

---

When invited to collaborate, you have to `Accept invitation` in order to start working on the repository:

![react to collaborator](./static/images/react-collaborator.png){width=75%}

---

## Issues

Issues can be used for multiple purposes: alerting colleagues about a bug in the code, proposing new features, discussing specific steps in the analysis,...

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
* Raise an `issue` online
* Provide issues with an appropriate `label`
* Assign your colleague to the issue
</div>

---

## Online adaptations

When there is no coding involved, e.g. you just need to update a few text lines in a markdown file, the usage of the online GitHub features could be sufficient enough: 

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
* Make an adaptation to an online file
* Propose a `pull request` and assign your collaborator
* Merge the adaptation to the `main` branch
</div>

---

## Local adaptations

In this section, all the individual steps come together to collaborate on the code of your project. First, we will start with a rehearsel of the individual steps as an exercise. Afterwards, we will try out a workflow that can be used as a step by step procedure in the future.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h4>Remember!</h4>
**Working on a local branch - merging online**
</div>

---

You can interpret the following exercise as a wrap-up of the steps learnt in the previous section:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-exercise">
<h4>Exercise:</h4>
* As collaborator, `clone` the other repository to your local computer
* Create a new `branch` locally with a different name
* Adapt the content of a file
* `Commit` your adaptation
* `Push` your `branch` to the remote repository
* Go to GitHub and make a `Pull request`
* Revise the work and `merge` online when appropriate
* Update your local work
* Check if all adaptations are represented in your local files
</div>

**Tip**: All functionalities are described in the previous sections

---

## Step by step workflow

The steps of the previous exercise provide the main building blocks. Nevertheless, when working on a project, a step by step procedure can help in the beginning to remember the workflow. A dedicated version for Rstudio is available at this repo as a separate [workflow overview](./workflow_rstudio.html).

---

## Release

Once you are satisfied with the status of your analysis, it makes sense to create a release:

* For publications (DOI)
* For code/software development versions
* For course notes

Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) to create a release.

---

# Some more *Rules for collaboration*:

* Commit often, make small commits
* Don't mix changes in 1 commit
* Think about your commit messages
* Always commit into a feature branch, never in the `main` branch.
* Always start features branches from the `main` branch.
* Only work in your own branches.
* Never merge someone else's `pull request` without their consent.
* Don't keep long-lived branches (form of technical debt)

---
